# Mutable Digraph

## Status

Experimental, proof of concept.

## Motivation

Graph algorithms often present a computational challenge.
There are (at least 2) popular implementations of digraph (`:digraph` and `libgraph`).

`sumalak` aims for an efficient implementation using :atomics for digraph representation.
